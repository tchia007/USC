when testing, put the "in" folder on your ec2 machine, do not create the "out" folder (and should delete the "out" folder first before next try).
the framework will automatically create the out folder with the name you specified in the execution.
contents in "out" will include some other files generated by the system.
here we only include "part-r-00000" to show you the result of this test sample.
