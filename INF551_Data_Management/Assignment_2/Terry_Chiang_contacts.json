purpose would have its own tags and within those tags would be emergency contact
each person's data would be within their own element. for example the person david small would look like the following:
the same applies for John Smith. he would get his own person element. 
when we get to the address, we can simply make street, city, state, and postal code their own elements within the address element.
when we get to phoneNumbers, we can do the same as with address. within the phoneNumbers element, we can add phoneNumber as its own element. 
There would be 2 different phoneNumbers element. Within the phoneNumbers elements, they would have tags of type and number with their values respectively.
