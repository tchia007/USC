The entire thing would be an object. 
Items would be the first key and the value would an object.  
Within the object of items, would be a key value of "book" : object 
The object of book contains "publisher" : "Addison-Wesley" 
Another object of hte book is the value "author" : array  
The first element of the array would be "Serge" : "Abiteboul"
The next element would be an object where the keys are "frst-name" and "last_name" for Rick and Hull resectively. 
Then there would be another object of the author array with "age" : "20" 
and "text" : "Victor Vianu". That concludes the author array. 
The following title, year, and price would be their own key : value pairs with their repsective values. "title" : "Foundations of Databases" etc...
That concludes the book's object. 

cd would be the next key value of items. the value of the cd would be an object. 
Inside this object would be "publisher" : "Freeman". 
The author would be a key and the value would be an array. Inside the array is an object with the key "age" and "text" with text being "Mary Lee" as the value. 
This ends the array. 
Then the title, year, and price attribute would become their own keys and their values would be filled in with their values such as "title" : "A wonderful world!" and so on. 
This concludes the cd' object. 

This concludes the items object.
